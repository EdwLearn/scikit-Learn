# Exploration and Production Deployment with Scikit-Learn

This project has been implemented using the powerful machine learning library, scikit-learn, to explore different machine learning models, automated to search for the most effective one across our various datasets.

To ensure a clean and reproducible development environment, we have "partitioned" this project into 3 main sections:

1) Virtual Environment and Project Schema
2) Machine Learning Techniques with Scikit-Learn
3) Production Deployment with Flask

## Machine Learning Techniques with Scikit-Learn 

The project is organized as follows:

- **scripts:** This folder contains Python files `.py` that contain code for different parts of the project.

- **notebooks:** Here you will find Jupyter Notebook files `.ipynb` that also contain code related to the project.

Both folders contain the same information and functionality; however, they have been separated in this way for the reader's convenience. The files in the `scripts` folder are in `.py` format, making them easy to execute in a standard Python development environment. Meanwhile, the files in the `notebooks` folder are in Jupyter notebook format, allowing for interactive exploration and the ability to document the process step by step.

Additionally, each file is explained and commented in detail for a better understanding by the reader. Comments in the code explain the logic behind each step, the parameters used, and any other relevant information that helps understand the functioning of the implemented machine learning models.
